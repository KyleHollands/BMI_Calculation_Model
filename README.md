# BMI_Calculation_Model
A personal MLR project that predicts BMI based on a few predictors: Height, Gender and Weight. When completing P-Value Backwards Elimination, Height was not considered statistically significant, and was removed. However, the dataset was also not that large, so it's possible the predictor may in actuality, be significant. In this case, Height was not kept in the final model, but is present in another.
