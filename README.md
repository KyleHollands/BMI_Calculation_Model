# BMI_Calculation_Model
A Data Analysis project to predict BMI. The project considered three predictors: height, gender, and weight. Using P-value Backwards Elimination, height was found to be non-significant and was removed from the model. However, the dataset was small, so it is possible that height is actually significant. Ultimately, height was not included in the final model but was kept in another model.

After incorporating the Height predictor into another model, the predictions generated by both models are nearly identical. Based on its performance in real-world scenarios, it seems that Height could potentially be a valuable predictor, but further analysis using a larger dataset is necessary to confirm this.
